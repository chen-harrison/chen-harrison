## 🤖 Hi, I'm Harrison, a robotics software engineer.

### About

I have primarily worked on mapping, perception, and localization algorithms for robotic systems, and my career interests are in the realm of SLAM and computer vision. I'm a self-driven learner who enjoys working on complex challenges while collaborating with others. My goal is to apply my robotics knowledge to build technologies that make a positive impact.

If you'd like to contact me, please feel free to reach out over email or LinkedIn, both located in my profile.

### Proficiencies

**Software:** C++, Python, Bash, Git, Docker, MATLAB, CI/CD \
**Robotics:** ROS/ROS 2, OpenCV, Eigen, 3D geometry, sensor calibration

### Personal Work

- Contributed documentation and code PRs into open-source repos (e.g. ROS 2, Gazebo)
- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/chen-harrison/dotfiles) for maintaining a portable set of configurations
- [Linux installation scripts](https://github.com/chen-harrison/linux-setup) that allow me to configure and spin up a clean install of Ubuntu quickly
- [Container registry](https://github.com/chen-harrison/containers) which uses GitHub Actions to maintain a 'tools' Docker image that allows me to pull helpful packages into my images used for development

### Currently Working On

- [Photogrammetric Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgnQpQtFTOGTPQhKBOGgjTgX-mzpsOGOX) course (Cyrill Stachniss)
