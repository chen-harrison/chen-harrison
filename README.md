## 🤖 Hi, I'm Harrison, a robotics software engineer.

### About

I have primarily worked on developing and integrating mapping, perception, and localization algorithms for robotic systems. My main career interests are in the realm of mobile robotics, SLAM, and computer vision. I am a self-driven learner who enjoys tackling complex challenges while collaborating with others. My goal is to apply my robotics knowledge to build technologies that make a positive impact.

If you'd like to contact me, please feel free to reach out over email or LinkedIn, both located in my profile.

### Proficiencies

**Software:** C++, Python, Git, Docker, MATLAB, CI/CD \
**Robotics:** ROS/ROS 2, OpenCV, Eigen, 3D geometry, sensor calibration

### Personal Work

- Merged documentation and code PRs into open-source repos, e.g. ROS 2 and Gazebo
- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/chen-harrison/dotfiles) for maintaing a portable set of configurations
